# Pong-Python
This is a Python script for a game called Pong, implemented using the Pygame library. The game consists of two paddles and a ball, and the objective is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.
This implementation includes a scoring system and the ability to move the paddles using the keyboard. The script defines the Game and Paddle classes, as well as several user-defined functions. To play the game, the main() function should be called, which initializes the game and starts the main game loop.
